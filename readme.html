<h2 id="asuperstripped-downstarterwordpressthemefordevelopers.basedontemplatewhichisbasedonbones.">A super stripped-down starter WordPress theme for developers. Based on Template, which is based on Bones.</h2>

<p>Plate evolved from Template which is based on the amazing Bones starter theme by Eddie Machado: http://themble.com/bones.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Bones, I highly suggest you check it out before using Template. Bones is exquisitely commented and meant to be a learning tool.</p>

<p>I make no Bones (pun definitely intended) about Template copying a lot of what was included in Bones but wanted to customize it for my studio&#8217;s workflow. This may or may not work for you.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we&#8217;ve removed some things I never used in Bones (like Link Pages, tags on pages and IE8 grids amongst others) and added some things in that we use often: more page templates, updated default font stack, a custom post type plugin template, and some custom functions.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve also included some extras and goodies that developers may find useful but kept those out of the main files.</p>

<p>For Plate, we&#8217;ve stripped everything down to the bare minimums so you can build it up how you like. If you want, you can copy things over from Template as you need.</p>

<p>Edit this, fork it, change it, delete it - whatever. As Eddie might say: it&#8217;s your world. But I hope you make something cool with it.</p>

<h2 id="alittlehistory">A Little History</h2>

<p>My introduction to Bones came seven years ago after trying out just about every starter theme out there. Once I found Bones I was hooked and have used it ever since on hundreds of projects. Bones got me to use Sass/SCSS, taught me a ton about WordPress, how themes <em>really</em> work, and made me a better developer.</p>

<p>Yet, over time I found I was making the same changes to Bones at the start of every project and this was taking up valuable time. Thus, I created the predecessor to this theme called &#8216;Osseous&#8217; which included some of the changes found in Template. Osseous literally means: &#8216;of, relating to, or composed of bone&#8217; and was a good departure point.</p>

<p>Template picks up where Osseous left off and takes things a bit further with &#8216;Template&#8217;. It includes namespaced functions and customized defaults along with a lot of other stuff I like and use for my development. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Plate strips everything down even further for those who want to build from scratch (although with a few key defaults left in).</p>

<p>2017 Update: we&#8217;ve gone through and done a major rewrite, adding and updating the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>updated to normalize.css 7.0</li>
<li>namespaced all functions</li>
<li>updated readme</li>
<li>updated login.scss</li>
<li>updated admin functions</li>
<li>added favicons, new apple touch icons and theme screenshot</li>
<li>added default system font stack</li>
<li>added .ai files for theme images</li>
<li>WordPress Customizer support</li>
<li>WooCommerce theme support</li>
<li>updated body class function</li>
<li>expanded Quicktags</li>
<li>template part library (really cool)</li>
<li>updated comments</li>
<li>cleaned up header.php</li>
<li>admin and login page updates</li>
<li>updated media query .scss stylesheets</li>
<li>removed @2x and ie_grid (who uses those?)</li>
<li>HTML schema support</li>
<li>default .scss classes</li>
<li>added source maps (yay!)</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8230;and much, much more.</p>

<p>See the changelog: https://github.com/joshuaiz/plate/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md</p>

<p>This is the beginning for Plate (and Template) so we welcome improvements, comments, criticism and general feedback. I&#8217;ve probably made a ton of mistakes so as with anything open source, it is a work in progress.</p>

<h2 id="recommendedplugins">Recommended Plugins</h2>

<p>Some of the stuff in Template references plugins that I use with just about every site and I recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced Custom Fields (Pro): https://www.advancedcustomfields.com. A must-have.</li>
<li>WP Retina 2x: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-retina-2x/. Works with WP built-in retina support. Just install and forget it.</li>
<li>EWWW Image Optimizer: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/. Smush all of the images. Automagically.</li>
<li>Plugin Organizer: https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-organizer/. Selective plugin loading on a per-page, per-post and per-type basis. Word.</li>
<li>WP Migrate DB Pro: https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/. Indispensable tool if you work on sites locally (and you should).</li>
</ul>
